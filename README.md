# AI HealthBridge: Localized Health Assistant for Underserved Communities

## 🌟 Project Overview

AI HealthBridge is a web-based AI platform that offers community-level healthcare assistance to underserved and rural areas, focusing on:

- Symptom-based preliminary diagnosis
- Local language support via NLP
- Community health education
- Connecting patients to the nearest verified healthcare providers or government schemes

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Access to basic healthcare information and early diagnostics is limited in rural or underserved communities due to a lack of healthcare professionals, awareness, and infrastructure. AI HealthBridge aims to bridge this gap using technology.

### 2. Community Health Forum

- Verified professionals can answer
- Moderation via AI to prevent misinformation

### 3. Health Campaign Alert System

### 4. Medical Directory
- Connects to verified local clinics, pharmacies, and ambulance services
- Filter based on government or low-cost services

### 5. Offline Mode (Planned Feature)
- Critical features cached for offline use in areas with limited connectivity
